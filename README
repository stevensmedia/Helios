Suggestion for getting the toolchain set up:

1. Use emsdk to download Emscripten and get it set up

2. Install cmake

3. install aqtinstall from the Python pip repository

4. Use aqtinstall to install a native Qt install for your platform, and then a
WASM install

5. Get cmake, the WASM Qt, and Emscripten in your path.

6. qmake; make; cd dist && emrun Helios.html
